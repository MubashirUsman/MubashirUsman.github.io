                <h3>What language should you learn</h3>
                <p>Programming languages vary in how much abstraction they offer to the programmer. This ranges from no abstraction, 
                    reffered low level, to high abstraction which are called high level languages.</p>

                <h3>Some useful scenarios while using git</h3>
                <p>Git is everywhere. Here I want to share some 'how-tos' for everyday usage.</p>
                <div class="read-more-content">
                    <p>To edit a previous commit, you can reset with <strong>--soft</strong> flag</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>git reset --soft *commit*</strong> </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Then you can make changes and then commit and push again, now to push you should use <strong>--force</strong> flag.</p>
                    <ul>

                <h3>What you should know about interrupts</h3>
                <p>Interrupts are <i>events</i> that can occur at any time and stop the execution of a program. An interrupt must be
                handled by the OS, and OS maintains a table that has interrupt handlers listed.</p>
                <div class="read-more-content">
                    <p> <strong>Synchronous</strong> interrupt is usually generated by an instruction (also called exceptions), are detected by cpu.
                        for example, divide by zero.
                    <strong>Asynchronous </strong> interrupts are generated by external devices (also called interrupts). 
                    for example, network card generates an interrupt to signal that a packet has arrived.
                     </p>
                     <p> <strong>Maskable</strong> interrupts can be ignored by the cpu if it has to complete another task, 
                        while <strong>non-maskable</strong> interrupts cannot be ignored.

                <h3>How a user code and Kernal co-exists: Exceptional Control Flow</h3>
                <p>A process is a running instance of a program. Fudamentally it consists of memory and some values stored in registers.
                     Memory consists of code that user wrote and some kernal code.</p>
                <div class="read-more-content">
                    <p>To change the state of the system, like writing to disk, sending network packets, respond to Ctrl+C, writing bytes on screen,
                        then trasnfer of control
                        to kernal is needed. Why? Because we don't want user prgram to do such sensitive things.
                        Kernal is collection of some exception handlers which are called when something happens. Kernal does not run on its own, but it sets the timer on CPU to run
                        user code for some time and then wake up the kernal if the user program is still not complete.
                        Exceptions are way to go from user level to supervisor/kernal level. Exceptions table (aka interrupt table) collection of instructions
                        that run when an exception occurs.
                        Example: exception table has entry for page fault with exception number 14 in intel x86.
                        <div><img src="exception_table.png" alt="exception table"></div>
                        Flow is: CPU timer fires ==> exception happens ==> kernal runs
                    </p>
                    <p> Its important to say that OS not only consists of kernal but also many other things and kernal is a subset of full OS.
                        Also root user is not kernal mode, it just runs user code with more privilages. Its entirely different from kernal mode.
                        Root user privilages are defined by OS and kernal mode privilages are defined by the CPU. Two things are entirely different.
                    </p>
                    <p>Four ways of moving from user mode to kernal mode (aka exceptions) are <i>interrupts</i>, <i>traps</i>, <i>faults</i> and <i>aborts</i>.
                        They are procedure call but unlike moving from one stack frame to another they move from one execution mode to another execution mode.
                        Asynchronous exceptions (interrupts) are external to currently running instruction. Indicated by processor's interrupt pin.
                        

                    </p>
                    <p> What is Process Context? When a process is in execution, it has some current operating state that must be stored somewhere to resume
                        the operations again. This operating state is process's memory, 
                        registers etc. The act of removing a process from execution state is called process switch. In process
                        switch, the mapping will also be swictched to point to another process memory.
                    </p>
                    <p> <strong>Context switch</strong> is a smaller version of <strong>process switch</strong>. It happens when 
                        an interrupt or a Syscall is being handled and needs less storing of state. </p>
